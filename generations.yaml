    description: "The original Dacia Sandero was a budget-friendly supermini built on the Renault-Nissan B0 platform shared with the first-generation Dacia Logan. Featuring simple, functional styling and a basic hatchback layout, it prioritized affordability and practicality over design flair. Engine options typically included 1.2L to 1.6L petrol units and a 1.5L dCi diesel, all focused on reliability and economy rather than performance. The interior was spartan but durable, with minimal technology features and simple, hard-wearing materials. Despite its no-frills approach, the Sandero offered good interior space for its class and reasonable build quality for its price point. This generation established the Sandero as Dacia's entry-level hatchback, appealing to value-conscious buyers across Europe and developing markets."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The second-generation Sandero maintained the value-oriented approach but with improved design, quality, and features. Built on an updated B0 platform, it featured more contemporary styling while preserving its practical, unpretentious character. Engine options evolved to include more efficient units, including a 0.9L TCe turbocharged three-cylinder. The interior saw significant improvements in design and material quality, with higher trims offering features previously unavailable including a touchscreen infotainment system. The Stepway variant, with its increased ride height (40mm), roof rails, and plastic body cladding, gained significant popularity, accounting for a large proportion of sales in many markets. A facelift in 2016 updated the front and rear styling and added LED daytime running lights. This generation significantly increased the Sandero's appeal beyond purely budget-conscious buyers, becoming Europe's best-selling retail car model by the end of its production run."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Sandero represents a major step forward, switching to the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-B platform shared with the Renault Clio. This change brings significant improvements in refinement, safety, and technology while maintaining competitive pricing. The exterior design is more modern and sophisticated, with LED lighting and improved proportions. Engine options include a 1.0L naturally aspirated SCe, a 1.0L turbocharged TCe, and a factory-fitted LPG bi-fuel system on some models. The interior features a completely redesigned dashboard with improved ergonomics, materials, and technology, including an available 8-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone integration. Safety features have been dramatically enhanced with standard automated emergency braking and other advanced driver assistance systems. The popular Stepway variant continues with crossover-inspired styling elements and increased ground clearance. Despite these improvements, the third-generation Sandero remains one of the most affordable new cars in Europe, maintaining Dacia's value proposition while significantly reducing the compromises associated with budget vehicles."
